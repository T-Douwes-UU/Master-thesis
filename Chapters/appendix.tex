\chapter{Homology and cohomology}\label{chap:homology}

The concepts of homology and its dual counterpart cohomology are indispensable tools in the mathematical field of algebraic topology. While seemingly abstract to from a physics point of view, many fundamental elements of the physicist's toolbox---such as Stokes' theorem---are formulated most naturally in the context of this theory. Additionally, there are deep results relating the cohomology of a space to the classification of different types of vector bundles over this space. Physically, this relates to the classification of topological phases of matter to which this work is dedicated.

Here we offer a brief introduction to these concepts, aimed at the uninitiated physicist. The goal here is not to be completely rigorous, but to give a sufficiently comprehensive understanding that the applications discussed in the main text %TODO in later chapters?
may be understood in their proper context. For a more complete picture, the interested reader is referred to standard texts in algebraic topology such as Refs.~\cite{Hatcher_algebraic-topology} and \cite{Bredon_topo-geometry}. A more geometric treatment relying on differential forms is also found in Ref.~\cite{Bott-Tu_differential-forms}.

The basic idea underlying homology is that information about the topology of a space $M$ can be gained from studying non-trivial subspaces of $M$ of various dimensions. Perhaps the simplest conceptual realisation of this idea exists in the closely related \emph{homotopy} theory. In this theory, one defines the $n$th homotopy group $\pi_n(M)$ in terms of maps from the $n$-dimensional sphere $S^n$ into $M$. For example, the first homotopy group $\pi_1(M)$ (also known as the \emph{fundamental group}) records the topologically different ways in which loops $\gamma:S^1\to M$ can sit inside $M$. If two such loops cannot be transformed continuously into each other, then they represent different elements of $\pi_1(M)$. %TODO physical applications

Despite their conceptual simplicity, homotopy groups can be rather unwieldy in practice: they are generally difficult to compute and may have unpredictable structures. For example, even maps from $S^n$ to a lower-dimensional $S^m$ with $m<n$ may be non-trivial, and calculating the associated higher homotopy groups $\pi_n(S^m)$ of the spheres is an important open problem in algebraic topology.

This is where the closely related homology enters the stage. It is conceptually somewhat more involved than homotopy, and strictly speaking it contains less information. However, there is a great payoff: homology groups are generally much easier to compute and structurally simpler than their homology counterparts. Moreover, homology can be dualized into cohomology, which is a construction which is both mathematically and physically very natural.


\section*{Homology}

The basic building blocks of homology theory are oriented subspaces of a space $M$.\footnote{
	There are several different ways of formally defining these oriented subspaces, such as mapping simplices (the $n$-dimensional analog of triangles) into $M$ or defining a so-called \emph{cell structure} on $M$. Importantly, these different constructions usually give rise to the same homology groups; because of this, we will be agnostic to the details and focus on the conceptual basis instead.} %TODO perhaps refer to app. B
Some such subspaces are illustrated for the two-dimensional torus in Figure~\ref{fig:homology-chains}.
\begin{figure}[htb!]

	\caption{The two-torus $\T^2$. Some of the oriented subspaces that make up chains in the homology theory are highlighted: components of 0, 1, and 2-chains are coloured blue, red and orange, respectively. The orientation of the 0D and 2D subspaces can be canonically induced from an orientation on the torus in this case.}
	\label{fig:homology-chains}
\end{figure}
Topological information can be gained from these subspaces by studying their (oriented) boundaries. The goal of homology is to find subspaces such as $d$ and $e$ in Figure~\ref{fig:homology-chains}, which do not have a boundary, but cannot themselves be written as the boundary of another subset either---unlike $c$, for instance, which is the boundary of $S$. Spaces like $d$ and $e$ detect topological features of the space, such as the hole in the centre of the torus.

To properly define oriented boundaries, we must work in the context of so-called $n$-\emph{chains}, which are linear combinations of $n$-dimensional subspaces of $M$. For example, $a+b$ is a 1-chain on the torus in Figure~\ref{fig:homology-chains}, as is $3a-2c$. Using $n$-chains makes boundaries well-behaved under addition. For example, we may define the boundary of $a$ as the 0-chain $\dee a = p - q$, and similarly $\dee b = q - r$; adding these up, we obtain
\begin{equation*}
	\dee a + \dee b = (p - q) + (q - r) = p - r,
\end{equation*}
which is precisely the boundary of the 1-chain $a+b$.

Formally, an $n$-chain takes the form
\begin{equation*}
	\sum_i c_i X_i,
\end{equation*}
where $X_i\subset M$ are oriented $n$-dimensional subsets of $M$. The coefficients $c_i$ are usually taken to be integers in $\Z$, but they may also be e.g.\ real numbers, rationals or elements of $\Z_2$; to be precise, they must be elements of any fixed Abelian group $G$, which is called the \emph{coefficient group}. A powerful result called the universal coefficient theorem %TODO cite
tells us that taking coefficients in the integers $G=\Z$ always results in the richest possible homology theory; this is why the coefficients are usually assumed to be elements of $\Z$ unless explicitly stated otherwise.

The $n$-chains on $M$ naturally form a group under addition in the coefficient group $G$, which we notate $C_n(M;G)$---or simply $C_n(M)$ when $G=\Z$. The inverses in this group act to invert the orientation of a chain: for example, the chain $-c$ on our torus looks like $c$ with the arrow pointing in the opposite direction.

The boundary of an $n$-chain is always an $(n-1)$-chain. This is even true for $n=0$; points have no boundary, so their boundary is the empty ``$(-1)$-chain'' in $C_{-1}(M;G) = 0$. This means taking the boundary defines\footnote{
	The precise definition of the boundary map depends on the way subspaces are defined, but the properties we discuss here are universal.}
a map $\dee_n$ from $C_n(M;G)$ to $C_{n-1}(M;G)$ for every integer $n$. These maps are group homomorphisms---that is, for integer or real coefficients, they are linear: for instance, we have already seen that $\dee(a+b) = \dee a + \dee b$ on our torus.

The boundary maps $\dee_n$ can be used to arrange the chain groups in a so-called \emph{chain complex}:
\begin{equation*}
	0 \overset{\dee_0}{\leftarrow} C_0(M;G) \overset{\dee_1}{\leftarrow} C_1(M;G) \overset{\dee_2}{\leftarrow} C_2(M;G) \overset{\dee_3}{\leftarrow} \cdots.
\end{equation*}
These chain complexes are usually finite: for example, the 2-torus in Figure~\ref{fig:homology-chains} has no 3-dimensional subspaces, so its chain complex (with integer coefficients) reads
\begin{equation*}
	0 \overset{\dee_0}{\leftarrow} C_0(\T^2) \overset{\dee_1}{\leftarrow} C_1(\T^2) \overset{\dee_2}{\leftarrow} C_2(\T^2) \overset{\dee_3}{\leftarrow} 0.
\end{equation*}
In practice, the subscript on the maps $\dee_n$ is often dropped when talking about specific subspaces.

A very important property of the chain complex is that composing two boundary maps always yields zero; this is often abbreviated as $\dee^2 = 0$. In other words, boundaries have no boundaries. An example of this can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:homology-chains}: the 1-chain $c$ is the boundary of the 2-chain $S$, but it does not have a boundary itself. In homology terms, chains like $c$ which have no boundaries are called \emph{cycles}. The set of $n$-cycles is denoted $Z_n$ and it forms a subgroup of the $n$-chain group. It is defined in terms of the kernel of $\dee_n$, i.e.\ the $n$-chains that map to the empty chain 0:
\begin{equation*}
	Z_n(M;G) := \ker(\dee_n) \subset C_n(M;G).
\end{equation*}

The property $\dee^2 = 0$ implies that all boundaries are cycles, but crucially, it does not imply the opposite: there may be cycles which are not boundaries. In Figure~\ref{fig:homology-chains}, $d$ and $e$ are such 1-cycles: we cannot find a 2-chain of which $d$ is the boundary, for instance. This implies that the set of $n$-chains which are boundaries is a subgroup of the group of $n$-cycles $Z_n$. The former group is called the group of $n$-\emph{boundaries} and denoted $B_n$. It is defined as the image of $\dee_{n+1}$:
\begin{equation*}
	B_n(M;G) := \im(\dee_{n+1}) \subset Z_n(M;G) \subset C_n(M;G).
\end{equation*}

We can now finally define the homology on $M$. The \emph{$n$th homology group} $H_n$ consists of all $n$-cycles modulo $n$-boundaries:
\begin{equation*}
	H_n(M;G) := \frac{Z_n(M;G)}{B_n(M;G)} = \ker(\dee_n) / \im(\dee_{n+1}).
\end{equation*}
Again, the coefficient group $G$ is often dropped from the notation under integer coefficients $G=\Z$. The elements of $H_n$ are called \emph{homology classes}, and they are equivalence classes of $n$-cycles. Two $n$-cycles $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are called \emph{homologous} if they differ only by a boundary, i.e.\ if $\gamma_1 = \gamma_2 + \dee\Gamma$ for some $n+1$ chain $\Gamma$. In this case they represent the same homology class, and we write $[\gamma_1] = [\gamma_2]\in H_n(M;G)$. For example, the 1-cycle $c$ in Figure~\ref{fig:homology-chains} is the boundary of the 2-chain $S$, and so it is homologous to the empty cycle: $c= 0 + \dee S$, meaning $[c] = 0\in H_1(\T^2)$. Similarly, any $n$-boundary represents the trivial class in $H_n$ in general. Intuitively, this is because a boundary can always be continuously retracted to a point (for example, $c$ can be retracted by shrinking $S$), where it vanishes and becomes the empty cycle.

Another important example of homologous cycles is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:homology-classes}.
\begin{figure}[htb!]
	\centering
	\def\svgwidth{.6\linewidth}
	\import{Images}{homology-classes.pdf_tex}
	\caption{The 2-torus $\T^2$, featuring the same 1-cycle $e$ as before, and also a 1-cycle $f$ which is obtained by moving $e$ along the torus. The boundary of the 2-chain $V$ indicated in orange is precisely the difference of these cycles: $\dee V = e - f$. Since $e$ and $f$ differ by a boundary, they are homologous, i.e.\ $[e]=[f]\in H_1(\T^2)$.} %TODO
	\label{fig:homology-classes}
\end{figure}
In this case, we see that non-trivial cycles may also represent the same homology class if they can be deformed into each other continuously.

These examples demonstrate an important general property: the homology group classifies cycles that differ from each other topologically, i.e.\ cannot be deformed into one another. As a result, the homology groups $H_n$ have a much simpler structure than the underlying chain groups. For example, the first homology group of the 2-torus $H_1(\T^2)$ consists precisely of elements of the form
\begin{equation*}
	m_d[d] + m_e[e],\quad m_d,m_e\in G=\Z,
\end{equation*}
where $d$ and $e$ are as in Figure~\ref{fig:homology-chains}. It follows that this group looks like two copies of $\Z$:
\begin{equation*}
	H_1(\T^2) \cong \Z^2.
\end{equation*}

The 0th homology group can be obtained by similar logic: all single points on $\T^2$ can be continuously moved to a single point $p$, so that elements of $H_0(\T^2)$ are of the form
\begin{equation*}
	m_p[p],\quad m_p\in\Z,
\end{equation*}
and consequently
\begin{equation*}
	H_0(\T^2) \cong \Z.
\end{equation*}
For similar reasons, if $M$ consists of $k$ connected components, then $H_0(M) = \Z^k$ in general.

Finally, the only two-dimensional subspace of $\T^2$ that represents a non-trivial homology class turns out to be the whole torus itself; as a result, $H_2$ also has a single generator:
\begin{equation*}
	H_2(\T^2) \cong \Z.
\end{equation*}
These three groups completely classify the homology of the 2-torus, since it only admits $n$-chains for $0\leq n\leq 2$. This is a general property of homology: unlike homotopy, where higher homotopy groups may have a highly non-trivial structure, the homology groups $H_n$ of a $d$-dimensional manifold are always 0 for $n>d$ and $n<0$.
