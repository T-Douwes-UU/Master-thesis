\section{Basic definitions}
{\color{blue}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Conductive properties of materials are understood in terms of band structure → Fermi energy. Conductance means Fermi level lies inside one of the bands. [picture]
	
	\item $N$-band system has hilbert space $\Hc\cong\C^N$, Hamiltonian represented by $N\times N$ matrix. Static system: $H\psi = E\psi$, eigenvalues are energy bands.
	
	\item Mostly interested in 2-band systems since only valence/conduction bands are relevant. Then $H$ is a $2\times 2$ Hermitian (for now) matrix. These are given by $H = h_0\mathbb{I} + \h\cdot\bm{\upsigma}$ in general; $h_0$ corresponds to the Fermi level and can be normalized to 0. [understand this better] → Bloch Hamiltonian [higher dimensional systems: Clifford algebra]
	
	\item For a Bloch Hamiltonian, eigenvalues are $\pm\abs{\h}$, so conductance occurs when $\h = 0$.
	
	\item Insulating Hamiltonians are adiabatically connected if they can be continuously deformed into each other without band crossings. Insulators are considered topological if they are not adiabatically connected to a reference trivial phase; then these inhabit different regions of the phase diagram → existence of edge states (not always\cite{Bernevig_topological-insulators}, footnote)

\subsection{Bloch theory}\label{subsection:bloch}
{\color{blue}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We work with crystalline materials which are composed of periodically repeating unit cells.
	
	\item In the bulk, we assume the Hamiltonian is periodic in the unit cell. This enables use of Bloch's theorem\cite{Bloch_theorem} $\psi(\vb{r}) = \e^{i\k\cdot\vb{r}}u_{\k}(\vb{r})$.
	
	\item Different values of crystal momentum may yield identical eigenstates, the set of equivalence classes is the Brillouin zone
	
	\item Brillouin zone usually has $\T^n$ topology, but internal symmetries etc. may alter this\cite{Foncesca-Vaidya_nonorientable} [other sources]
\end{itemize}

\section{One-dimensional models}
{\color{blue}
\begin{itemize}
	\item SSH is usually introduced "physics first", but we would like to work backwards in a sense, to see how bulk topology gives rise to physical properties of a system.

\subsection{The Su--Schrieffer--Heeger model}
We will take the approach of deriving the Su--Schrieffer--Heeger model by beginning with a generic one-dimensional crystal, and trying to make it topologically interesting the simplest way we can.

To begin with, we assume that the crystal extends infinitely in both directions. We will introduce a boundary later, but its relevant properties will turn out to be determined by the crystal's bulk topology. Concretely, we have a one-dimensional chain of unit cells indexed by $n\in\Z$; at this point, we do not make any assumptions on the internal structure of these unit cells. We require that the real-space Hamiltonian of the system is periodic in these unit cells, so that by Bloch's theorem, two crystal momenta $k$ and $k'$ are equivalent if they differ by an integer multiple of $2\pi$. This means we can take our Brillouin zone $B$ to be the interval $[-\pi,\pi]$ with the points $-\pi$ and $\pi$ identified, which is homeomorphic to $S^1$.

We might begin with a simple 2 band Bloch Hamiltonian $H(k) = \h(k)\cdot\bm{\upsigma}$, with
\[
	\h: B\cong S^1\to\R^3,\quad k\mapsto\begin{pmatrix}
		h_x(k) \\ h_y(k) \\ h_z(k)
	\end{pmatrix}.
\]
Such a Hamiltonian describes a gapped phase precisely when the map $\h$ is nowhere vanishing, so that the topological classification of these phases is given by classes of maps from $S^1$ to $\R^3$ minus the origin---that is, homotopy classes of loops in $\R^3\setminus\set{0}$. But this space has a trivial fundamental group $\pi_1\big(\R^3\setminus\set{0}\big)\cong0$, meaning all such loops can be contracted to a point; in other words, all gapped phases are adiabatically connected, and there are no topologically interesting phases.

To remedy this situation, we impose a constraint on the Hamiltonian: we require that $h_z(k)=0$, so that we effectively have a map $S^1\to\R^2$. The gapped phases are now classified by the group $\pi_1\big(\R^2\setminus\set{0}\big)\cong\Z$, indexed by winding number: loops that wind around the origin $a\in\Z$ times cannot be deformed into those with a different winding number $b\neq a$. In particular, loops with a non-zero winding number cannot be contracted to a point, and the associated phases are considered topological. Note that imposing a constraint on the Hamiltonian has made this system topologically interesting; once we move to the physical picture, we will see that this really amounts to imposing a certain symmetry on the system.

To arrive at a concrete physical system, let us begin with the simplest possible\footnote{Of course, our choice of $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinates very conveniently sets us up to arrive at the SSH model. However, mathematically speaking, all similar models are related by a simple change of basis.}
distinct states, one trivial and one topologically interesting:
\[
	\h_{\rm triv}(k) = \begin{pmatrix}
		1 \\ 0 \\ 0
	\end{pmatrix},\qquad \h_{\rm top}(k) = \begin{pmatrix}
		\cos(k) \\ \sin(k) \\ 0
	\end{pmatrix}.
\]
To characterise a phase transition between these two states, we look at the linear combination $\h(k) = v\h_{\rm triv}(k) + w\h_{\rm top}(k)$, with $v,w\geq0$. The phase described by the resulting Bloch Hamiltonian is trivial when $v>w$, gapless (conducting) when $v=w$, and topological when $v<w$; see Figure \ref{fig:phases}.

\end{figure}

Now that we have a simple setup, it's time to analyse the physics. Concretely, the momentum space Hamiltonian is given by
\begin{align*}
	H(k) &= \h(k)\cdot\bm{\upsigma} = \big(v + w\cos(k)\big)\sigma_x + w\sin(k)\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix}
		0 & v + w\e^{-ik} \\
		v + w\e^{ik} & 0
	\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}
We can set up a Fourier transform to real space by rewriting this suggestively in terms of the unit cell index $n$:
\[
	H(k) = \e^{-ik(n-n)}\begin{pmatrix}
		0 & v \\
		v & 0
	\end{pmatrix} + \e^{-ik\big((n+1)-n\big)}\begin{pmatrix}
		0 & w \\
		0 & 0
	\end{pmatrix} + \e^{-ik\big(n-(n+1)\big)}\begin{pmatrix}
		0 & 0 \\
		w & 0
	\end{pmatrix}
\]
{\color{red} I need to work out the details of this Fourier transform later, my calculations aren't working out. Transforming from a periodic Brillouin zone to (discrete or infinite) real space is breaking my brain. I imagine it needs to look something like this (where $M_{0/\pm1}$ are the three matrices above):
\begin{align*}
	\hat{H} &= \int_B H(k) \ket{k}\bra{k} \\
		&= \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\frac{\dd{k}}{2\pi} \left(\sum_{a\in\{0,\pm1\}}\e^{-ika}M_a\right) \left(\sum_{n}\e^{-ikn}\ket{n}\right) \left(\sum_{n'}\bra{n'}\e^{ikn'}\right) \\
		&= \sum_{a,n,n'}\left(\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\frac{\dd{k}}{2\pi}\e^{-ik(a+n-n')}\right)M_a\ket{n}\bra{n'} \\
		&= \sum_{a,n,n'}\delta_{n+a,n'}M_a\ket{n}\bra{n'} \\
		&= \sum_{a,n}M_a\ket{n}\bra{n+a}
\end{align*}
But I don't fully understand the first step, the sign of $a$ is wrong and normalization is broken. Maybe it's easier to discretize first and do a DFT?}

{\color{blue}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It follows [how exactly?] that we can write the Hamiltonian in a unit cell basis as
	\[
		\hat{H} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\ket{n}\bra{n}\otimes\begin{pmatrix}
			0 & v \\
			v & 0
		\end{pmatrix} + \left(\ket{n+1}\bra{n}\otimes\begin{pmatrix}
		0 & w \\
		0 & 0
		\end{pmatrix} + {\rm h.c.}\right)\right]
	\]
	
	\item We can introduce a boundary by setting finite $N$ with open BC:
	\[
		\hat{H} = \sum_{n=0}^{N}\ket{n}\bra{n}\otimes\begin{pmatrix}
			0 & v \\
			v & 0
		\end{pmatrix} + \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\left(\ket{n+1}\bra{n}\otimes\begin{pmatrix}
			0 & w \\
			0 & 0
		\end{pmatrix} + {\rm h.c.}\right)
	\]
	
	\item This case can be represented as
	\[
		\hat{H} = \begin{pNiceMatrix}
			\Block[borders={bottom,right,tikz=dashed}]{2-2}{}
			             0 & v & \Block[borders={bottom,right,tikz=dashed}]{2-2}{}
			                     0 & 0 & \Block{4-4}{0} &        &   & \\
			             v & 0 & w & 0 &                &        &   & \\
			\Block[borders={bottom,right,tikz=dashed}]{2-2}{}
			             0 & w & 0 & v &                &        &   & \\
			             0 & 0 & v & 0 &                &        &   & \\
			\Block{4-4}{0} &   &   &   &                & \Ddots & 0 & 0 \\
			               &   &   &   & \Ddots         &        & w & 0 \\
			               &   &   &   &              0 & w      & 0 & v \\
			               &   &   &   &              0 & 0      & v & 0
		\end{pNiceMatrix}
	\]
	
	\item This looks like a chain of length 2N with alternating hopping amplitudes, meaning we can realize the system in terms of unit cells with two atoms, intra-cell hopping $v$ and inter-cell hopping $w$. This is realised in e.g. polyacetylene\cite{SSH_model}: \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{Images/polyacetylene}
	
	\item The trivial $v>w$ case has strong hopping within the cells, including to and from the edge modes. The conducting $v=w$ phase is just a chain of equal hoppings, and the topological $v<w$ has weaker hopping inside the cells so that the edge modes become isolated.
	
	\item We can now physically interpret the meaning of setting $h_z = 0$: it ensures that hopping only occurs between the two sublattices $A$ and $B$, and not within them (i.e.\ there are only off-diagonal elements in the internal degrees of freedom). If we define the sublattice projection operators
	\[
		\hat{P}_A = \mathbb{I} \otimes \begin{pmatrix}
			1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0
		\end{pmatrix},\quad \hat{P}_B = \mathbb{I} \otimes \begin{pmatrix}
		0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1
		\end{pmatrix}
	\]
	then the Hamiltonian obeys
	\[
		\hat{P}_A\hat{H}\hat{P}_A = \hat{P}_B\hat{H}\hat{P}_B = 0
	\]
	and so since $\hat{P}_A + \hat{P}_B$ is the identity we have
	\begin{align*}
		\hat{H} &= (\hat{P}_A + \hat{P}_B)\hat{H}(\hat{P}_A + \hat{P}_B) \\
			&= \hat{P}_A\hat{H}\hat{P}_B + \hat{P}_B\hat{H}\hat{P}_A \\
			&= (\hat{P}_A - \hat{P}_B)\hat{H}(\hat{P}_B - \hat{P}_A) \\
			&\equiv -\hat{\Gamma}\hat{H}\hat{\Gamma}
	\end{align*}
	with $\hat{\Gamma}\equiv\hat{P}_A - \hat{P}_B$ having the property that $\hat{\Gamma} = \hat{\Gamma}^{-1} = \hat{\Gamma}\dagger$; this is called sublattice symmetry and it also applies to the momentum space Hamiltonian $H(k)$.
	
	\item An immediate consequence of our setup is that the trivial and topological phase become adiabatically connected if we allow for sublattice symmetry breaking ($h_z \neq 0$).
